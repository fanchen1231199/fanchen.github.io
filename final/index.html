    	<h2>Quotation Poster</h2>
    	<p>
    		"Imagination is more important than knowledge" is my favorite quote. As a designer, I strongly believe in this. When I was designing this quote poster,  I was thinking about the movie "up", so I kind get the inspiration from there. And I also felt imagination is like the ballon, it doesn't have "weight ", but they will be very powerful when they unit together.

    	<h2> Bangkok City Identity</h2>
    	<p>
    		The goal of this assignment is designing a city identity. My city is Bangkok which is the capital of Thailand.  “Temples”“Elephant” “water city” are important elements in my logo. Bangkok is a water city, 98% of residents are Buddhists, and elephants are the mascot in this country.

  	  <p>
  	  	This is a map we designed for Newbury Street. Newbury Street is Boston's most enchanting street. Eight blocks filled with salons, boutiques, and fabulous dining. Boston's Newbury Street has something for everyone. So in our map, we divided all the destinations to four categories, which are treat Yo self (luxuries shopping), Average shopping, Let’s get creative (gallery art day), Self Care and Relaxation. So no matter what is your goal, you will find a path belongs to you!
