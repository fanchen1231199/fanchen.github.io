<h1>What are design sprints? 
</h1>
<div>
  <p>
    The design sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers. Developed at <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">GV</a> ( Google Venture), it&#39;s a &#34;greatest hits&#34; of business strategy, innovation, behavior science, design thinking, and more &#45; packaged into a battle-tested process that any team can use.
  </p>
<p>
  Working together with companies in a sprint, we shortcut the usual endless-debate cycle and compress months of time into a single week. Instead of waiting to launch a minimal product to understand if an idea is any good, teams get great data from a prototype. The sprint gives these companies a superpower: The ability to build and test nearly any idea in just 40 hours.

   On Monday, you will unpack the problem.&#40;Understand&#41;
 </div>
 <div>
   On Tuesday, you will sketch competing solutions on paper.&#40;Diverge&#41;
 </div>
 <div>
   On Wednesday, you will argue and decide how to turn your ideas into a testable hypothesis. &#40;decide&#41;
</div>
<div>
  On Thursday, you will hammer out a high-fidelity prototype. &#40;prototype&#41;
</div>
<div>
  On Friday, you will test it with real live humans.&#40;validate&#41;

<h1> Who do they benefit and how?</h1>

  <h4>Who:</h4> 
  companies who want to solve the problem efficiently

      <h4>Benefit:</h4>
<p>
  Ideating, building a &#34;product&#34;, and testing it in front of users all in the span of one week is about as time and capital efficient as it gets. The ROI can be huge if you build a solution that resonates with people. And if you invalidate the idea, you just saved potentially months of development time and capital you can now devote to other ideas.
</p>
<p>
  Uncover usability flaws and unknown product hangups. Its often quite obvious after the fifth participant what specifically needs to be changed in the app. Good thing you found out now, instead of after spending all that money on development.
</p>
<p>
  Team alignment. Having all the stakeholders work closely together on the same goal and with the same information is intensely uniting. It can really a team together around the cause and bring energy to finding the best solution possible.
</p>
<p>
  Bringing in users can make the problem feel more concrete. In-depth interviews with the people who use your product humanize the &#34;user&#34;, which can have a positive and inspirational effect on the team.
</p>
<p>
  Creates a guiding artifact for software development. After the Design Sprint, you now have a workable, fluid prototype to develop against. This is great to bring to your developers as they can work off of it, saving you time writing specs and mitigating development risk.
</p>
<p>
  Prototyping frees you from the traditional time and capital constraints of building a product to test it. This enables you to try ideas that otherwise wouldn&#39;t be feasible to test out.
</p>
<p>
  Potential to resolve team conflicts around product disputes. Its often clear the direction to go after bringing study participants in the office as it&#39;s hard to argue with unbiased users.
</p>
<p>
  Time constraint boosts creativity and forces you to make product decisions quickly. No more shelving a decision until next week &#45; you are forced to deal with it now.
